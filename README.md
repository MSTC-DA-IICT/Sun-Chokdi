# Sun-Chokdi
For Hacktoberfest 2021

# <i> Sun-Chokdi </i>
<i>Sun-Chokdi</i> is an android application for playing standard 2-player tic-tac-toe game. It provides a board to put 'X's and 'O's and displays the result at the end of the game. So currently it is just a single-screen application that has a huge scope of further improvements and enhancements be it in terms of adding a new feature like playing against machine, storing game results or changing the UI, etc.
